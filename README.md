## Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERTÂ¶
### Prerequisites
1. Intermediate-level knowledge of Python 3 (NumPy and Pandas preferably, but not required)
2. Exposure to PyTorch usage
3. Basic understanding of Deep Learning and Language Models (BERT specifically)

For the purpose of this project I am going to use **huggingface.co** implementation of transformers.BERT* PyTorch implementation.
